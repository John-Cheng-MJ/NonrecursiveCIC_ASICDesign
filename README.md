# NONCIC-ASIC
This is project of digital ASIC for Non-recursive CIC filter

Verilog file of the project you can find in Source folder by Non-recursive CIC1 name

to create ASIC you need to follow several steps:
1) Run simulation in incisive for ur verilog files from fixed-point modle
2) Run synthesis in RTL_Complier folder and run RTL_Compiler 
3) To disign layout open folder Encounter and run coomand Encounter
4) To make verification in Virtuoso and import the physical list verilog files
5) Run remaster instances. Write "abstract" and for update for write "layout"
6) Place pins and lables
